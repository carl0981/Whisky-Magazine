                <h2>In General</h2>
                <p>
                    Whisky is a dark spirit that is distilled from a fermented grain mash. And what does that mean? <br><br> 
                    <em>Fermentation</em> is the chemical reaction of sugars being converted into alcohol. <br>
                    <em>Grain</em> is a cereal crop such as barley, corn, rye, and wheat. <br>
                    <em>Mash</em> is a combination of grains and water. <br><br>
                    So that basically means the whisky is created from a process where the sugars in the grains are
                    broken down <br> and turned into alcohol. You will get a better understanding of this later in the "how it's made" article.<br><br><br> 
                    <strong>What is Scotch Whisky? Bourbon? Single Malt? Blended?</strong><br><br>
                    There are many different kinds of whisky and yes, they can get confusing, 
                    but hopefully, it will make sense at the end of this article. <br> The different types of whisky 
                    depend on mostly 3 things: <br><em> What it is made from, where it is made, and how long it
                    has been aged. </em><br> Also, the different types of whisky must be aged in specific types of barrels,
                    <br> for example - bourbon must be aged in new barrels, <br>
                    whereas Scotch whisky mostly uses used barrels because the wood empathizes the taste and color.
                    <br> For darker Scotch whisky, barrels that have been used to mature cherry and port are typically used. <br>
                    While for their lighter whiskies, the used bourbon barrels are actually used<br><br>
                    <em>These are the different types of whiskies, also notice how the spelling of whisk(e)y changes for each country:</em><br><br>

                    <ul class="ul">
                        <li><em><strong> Single Malt </strong></em><em> Whisk(e)y </em>is the term used to distinguish a whisky that is made at one single distillery using a single malted grain.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><em><strong> Blended </strong></em><em> Whisk(e)y </em>refers to any kind of whisky that is blended with various types of whiskies that have already been aged, 
                            typically made from types of grain</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><em><strong> Scotch </strong></em><em> Whisky </em>must be made in Scotland and contains 100% malted barley and has been aged at least 3 years in oak casks. 
                            Almost all smoky(peated) whiskies come from here. The taste of the whisky varies a lot depending on the region it's made in.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><em><strong> Irish </strong></em><em> Whiskey </em>is whiskey distilled in Ireland and will most often be blended, but single malts are also available. 
                            The taste of their whiskeys are known for being light, smooth, and easy drinkable</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><em><strong> Bourbon </strong></em><em> Whiskey </em>has to be made in America and has to be made using at least 51% corn. 
                            It is aged in new oak barrels as opposed to. The taste varies a lot.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><em><strong> Tennessee </strong></em><em> Whiskey </em>is bourbon whiskey just made in Tennessee, though it's charcoal
                            filtered. Which mellows the whiskey, and gives it a slightly burnt wood flavor.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><em><strong> Rye </strong></em><em> Whisk(e)y </em>has no specific geographical place it has to be made, though most are made in North America.
                            Instead, the majority of the whisky has to be made of Rye, though there may be used other grain as well. The taste tends to be spicy.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><em><strong> Canadian </strong></em><em> Whisky </em>is famous for its blended whiskies, as they are known as some of the smoothest in the world.
                            Rye is mostly used, but they use a lot of different whisky types to make the perfect blend. Even cherry can be used</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><em><strong> Japanese </strong></em><em> Whisky </em>is based on Scotch whisky and is therefore almost identical, but can not be called a Scotch whisky as its made in Japan.
                            Japanese whisky is generally considered very fine whisky and is typically oily, buttery smooth, and sometimes peated.</li>

                    Scotland remains the most well-known producer of whisky and has 5 different whisky production regions. <br>
                    The regions are called Highland, Lowland, Islay, Speyside, and Campbeltown. Each has its own unique palette of flavors. <br><br>

        <h1 class="headings">How It's Made</h1>
        <div class="gallery">
            <p class="pg">
                A Scotch single malt whisky is made using only 3 natural raw ingredients: barley, yeast, and fresh Scotch spring water. 
                <br><br> Although each distillery has their own unique specifications in process of making their whisky, the overall process remains the same. 
                <br><br><br><strong class="pgh"> 1. &nbsp;&nbsp; Malting </strong><br><br> Before the process can begin the barley have to be malted. The barley is steeped in water to absorb the water into the grains. Then the barley will be evenly laid out on the malting floors so the germination process can begin (see image). 
                <br><br> During this process, the barley is turned regularly to prevent the buildup of heat. Depending on the temperature the barley begins to germinate between 4-9 days. This means that the enzymes are being activated which starts growth in the grains. This is important as the starch within the barley can then be turned into sugar when the mashing takes place (more on this later).
            </p>
            <img src="image/malting.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="pg">
                <strong class="pgh"> 2. &nbsp;&nbsp; Drying </strong><br><br> 
                After the germination of the barley now called green malt, it has it to go to the kiln for drying. The kiln is a big furnace with a big floor above it where the green malt is placed. The furnace will then heat up the floor, resulting in drying of the green malt which stops the germination (see image). 
                <br><br> The heat is kept below 70 degrees so the enzymes will not be destroyed. Here the peat will also be added to the furnace if the distillery wants a peated whisky.
            </p>
            <img src="image/drying.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="pg">
                <strong class="pgh"> 3. &nbsp;&nbsp; Mashing </strong><br><br>
                Once it is dried, the malt is ground to a coarse flour called “grist”, and then mixed with fresh hot Scotch spring water in a large machine called a “mash tun” (see image). The quality of the pure Scottish water is very important as it will impact the flavor. 
                <br><br> The water is added in 3 different stages each time getting hotter, starting at about 65 degrees, and rising to almost boiling temperature. The mash is stirred constantly, helping to convert the starches into sugar. 
                <br><br> After mashing there will be a sweet sugary liquid left that is known as “wort”. The spent grains are processed into cattle feed. 
            </p>
            <img src="image/mash-tun.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="pg">
                <strong class="pgh"> 4. &nbsp;&nbsp; Fermentation </strong><br><br>
                The wort is then cooled to about 20 degrees and pumped into the fermentation tank, the so-called “washback” (see image). Here the yeast is added so the fermentation can begin.
                <br><br> The fermentation is happening because the yeast feeds on the sugar, producing alcohol but also small quantities of other compounds called “congeners”, that contribute to the flavor of the whisky. The liquid now called the “wash” also produces carbon dioxide which makes the wash froth a lot, making it almost look like beer. 
                <br><br> About 2-4 days after, the fermentation dies down and the wash now contains 6-11% alcohol by volume.
            </p>
            <img src="image/washbacks.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="pg">
                <strong class="pgh"> 5. &nbsp;&nbsp; Distillation </strong><br><br>
                Now the wash is ready to be distilled for the first time. To initiate the distillation process, the wash is heated in the first copper pot-still called the wash still (see right side of image). Here the alcohol will be separated from the water, yeast, and residue called “pot ale”. 
                <br><br> In distillation, the pot-still is heated to just below the boiling point, and because alcohol vaporizes at a lower temperature than water, only the alcohol evaporates and passes up throw the neck of the still and into the condenser where the alcohol vapors are cooled and then becomes liquid called “low wines” and has an alcohol content of 20-25%.
                <br><br> The distillation process is now repeated with the low wines in a second smaller pot-still the so-called “spirit still” (see left side of image). This usually takes around 8 hours. In this step, the alcohol and most of the flavorings and aromatic substances are again separated from the water and concentrated. Resulting in a fine distillate with an alcohol content of 65-70% volume.
            </p>
            <img src="image/stills.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="pg">
                <strong class="pgh"> 6. &nbsp;&nbsp; Spirit Safe </strong><br><br>
                The distillate is now separated by the distiller in the “spirit safe” (see image) to collect the most flavorful of the liquid, called the “heart”. 
                <br><br> The parts of the distillate that is not part of the heart, are called the “heads” and “tails” and refer respectively to the first and last parts of the distillate that comes off the still. These parts will be re-distilled or discarded because they contain compounds that don’t make for tasty whisky. Where these “cuts” are made depends entirely on the distiller’s taste and the still used. 
                <br><br> Therefore, the distiller plays an important role in choosing where to make the cuts in the spirit safe and can change the taste of the whisky depending on that.
            </p>
            <img src="image/spirit-safe.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="pg">
                <strong class="pgh"> 7. &nbsp;&nbsp; Maturing </strong><br><br>
                Now the heart of the fine distillate will be pumped into the spirit receiver and will be partially mixed with distilled water and be filled into oak barrels for final storage. 3 types of wood are accepted for the storage and maturing of whisky: American white oak, European oak, and Japanese oak.
                <br><br> Many years of aging in an oak barrel can account for 60-80% of the taste! Of course, the ingredients in the raw whisky, which is still very spicy after distillation also give it its distinct flavor. However, it is only through storage the whisky gets it's round and unique taste (see image).
                <br><br> Most single malt whiskies will lie in the oak barrels for 8, 10, 12, 15, 18 years, or even longer. So, when you take a sip, you taste not only the amazing flavors, you taste history.

                <p style="color: white;">No one knows exactly why, but the exact shape of the pot-still affects the character of the individual malt whisky, down to the smallest dent. Therefore, each distillery will almost never change their pot-stills.</p>

                <p style="color: white;">Under maturing, the wood of the barrel breathes and between 1,5 and 2 percent of the liquid gold evaporates annually. This was by the first distillers in history named “the angel's share” and is still the case to this day.</p>
